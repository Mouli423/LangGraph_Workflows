They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt. [...] Reasoning: This core cognitive process involves using logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems. AI agents with strong reasoning capabilities can analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence and context.\\n   Acting: The ability to take action or perform tasks based on decisions, plans, or external input is crucial for AI agents to interact with their environment and achieve goals. This can include physical actions in the case of embodied AI, or digital actions like sending messages, updating data, or triggering other processes. [...] Tools: Tools are functions or external resources that an agent can utilize to interact with its environment and enhance its capabilities. They allow agents to perform complex tasks by accessing information, manipulating data, or controlling external systems, and can be categorized based on their user interface, including physical, graphical, and program-based interfaces. Tool learning involves teaching agents how to effectively use these tools by understanding their functionalities and the context in which they should be applied.',\n",

Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a contact center AI agent that wants to resolve customer queries. The agent will automatically ask the customer different questions, look up information in internal documents, and respond with a solution. Based on the customer responses, it determines if it can resolve the query itself or pass it on to a human. [...] Multiple AI agents can collaborate to automate complex workflows and can also be used in agentic ai systems. They exchange data with each other, allowing the entire system to work together to achieve common goals. Individual AI agents can be specialized to perform specific subtasks with accuracy. An orchestrator agent coordinates the activities of different specialist agents to complete larger, more complex tasks.\\n\\nLearn more about what is artificial intelligence (AI)\\n\\n## What are the key principles that define AI agents?\\n\\nAll software autonomously performs various routine tasks as specified by the software developer. So, what makes AI agents special?\\n\\n### Autonomy [...] ### Proactivity\\n\\nAI agents can take initiative based on forecasts and models of future states. Instead of simply reacting to inputs, they anticipate events and prepare accordingly.\\n\\nFor instance, an AI-based customer service agent might reach out to a user whose behavior suggests frustration, offering help before a support ticket is filed. Autonomous warehouse robots may reposition themselves in anticipation of upcoming high-traffic operations.\\n\\n### Continuous learning\\n\\nAI agents improve over time by learning from past interactions. They identify patterns, feedback, and outcomes to refine their behavior and decision-making. This differentiates them from static programs that always behave the same way regardless of new inputs.',\n",

       "'**Attention Is All You Need**  \\n*Publication*: 2017, Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)  \\n*Authors*: Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. What the paper is about  \\nThe paper introduces the **Transformer**, a novel neural network architecture that relies **solely on attention mechanisms**—specifically, *self‑attention*—to model sequential data. It replaces the recurrent (RNN) and convolutional (CNN) layers that dominated sequence‑to‑sequence (seq2seq) work (e.g., machine translation) with a stack of multi‑head self‑attention and fully‑connected layers.\\n\\n### 2. Why it matters  \\n- **Parallelization**: Self‑attention allows all tokens in a sequence to be processed simultaneously, vastly speeding up training on GPUs/TPUs compared to sequential RNNs.  \\n- **Long‑range dependencies**: Attention directly connects any two positions in the sequence, making it easier to capture relationships that are far apart.  \\n- **State‑of‑the‑art results**: The Transformer achieved the best BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English‑German and English‑French translation tasks at the time of publication.  \\n- **Foundation for later models**: It paved the way for BERT, GPT, T5, and many other large‑scale language models that dominate NLP today.\\n\\n### 3. Core components of the Transformer\\n\\n| Component | Purpose | Key Idea |\\n|-----------|---------|----------|\\n| **Multi‑head Self‑Attention** | Each token attends to every other token in the same sequence | Projects queries, keys, values into multiple sub‑spaces (heads) and aggregates them |\\n| **Positional Encoding** | Provides order information (since attention is permutation‑invariant) | Adds sinusoidal or learned embeddings to token embeddings |\\n| **Feed‑Forward Networks (FFN)** | Adds non‑linear transformations | Two linear layers with ReLU (or GELU) in between, applied position‑wise |\\n| **Layer Normalization & Residual Connections** | Stabilizes training | Adds the input of a sub‑layer to its output before normalization |\\n| **Encoder / Decoder Stacks** | Encodes source sequence, decodes target sequence | Encoder has only self‑attention; decoder has masked self‑attention + encoder‑decoder attention |\\n\\n### 4. Training objective  \\nThe model is trained with the standard **cross‑entropy loss** over the target sequence tokens, using teacher forcing during training.\\n\\n### 5. Variants and extensions  \\n- **BERT**: Bidirectional Transformer encoder trained with masked language modeling (MLM) and next‑sentence prediction (NSP).  \\n- **GPT**: Unidirectional (autoregressive) Transformer decoder trained with language modeling.  \\n- **T5**: Text‑to‑text framework that casts all NLP tasks as sequence‑to‑sequence with a unified Transformer.  \\n- **Transformer‑XL, XLNet, Reformer, etc.**: Introduce recurrence, memory, sparse attention, or other efficiency tricks.\\n\\n### 6. Common misconceptions  \\n\\n| Misconception | Clarification |\\n|---------------|---------------|\\n| *The Transformer is just a fancy RNN.* | It contains no recurrence or convolution; all dependencies are captured via attention. |\\n| *Self‑attention is too computationally heavy.* | Quadratic complexity in sequence length can be mitigated by sparse, linear, or kernel‑based attention variants. |\\n| *Attention is only for NLP.* | Transformers are now used for vision (ViT), audio, protein folding, reinforcement learning, etc. |\\n\\n### 7. Practical tips for using Transformers\\n\\n| Task | Recommended model | Why |\\n|------|------------------|-----|\\n| **Machine translation** | mBART, mT5 | Fine‑tuned on multilingual corpora |\\n| **Text classification** | DistilBERT, RoBERTa | Lightweight, good performance |\\n| **Question answering** | BERT‑Large, ALBERT | Pre‑trained on SQuAD |\\n| **Text generation** | GPT‑3, GPT‑4 | Autoregressive decoding |\\n| **Vision tasks** | ViT, Swin Transformer | Feed images as patches |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## About the 2013 submission you mentioned\\n\\nThe arXiv entry you referenced—*“A Simulation and Modeling of Access Points with Definition Language”* by Tairen Sun—was withdrawn because it was found to contain fictitious content and was submitted under a pseudonym. It has **no relation** to the Transformer or the “Attention Is All You Need” paper. The correct citation for the Transformer is the 2017 NeurIPS paper above.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Quick take‑away\\n\\n- **Attention Is All You Need** introduced a fully attention‑based architecture that eliminated recurrence and convolution, enabling faster, more parallelizable, and more powerful models for sequence modeling.  \\n- It is the cornerstone of modern NLP and beyond, inspiring a family of large pre‑trained language models that dominate the field today.  \\n\\nFeel free to ask if you’d like deeper explanations of any component, implementation details, or how to fine‑tune a Transformer for a specific task!'"
